# üåê Introduction to Linux and Networking Tools

## üß† Part 1: Basic Computer Networking Concepts

Before using tools, it's essential to understand the fundamental components of computer networks:

### üì° Key Concepts

| Concept     | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IP Address  | Unique identifier for a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.10)      |
| Subnet      | Logical subdivision of a network                                      |
| Gateway     | Device that routes traffic to other networks                          |
| DNS         | Domain Name System ‚Äî translates domain names into IP addresses        |
| MAC Address | Hardware address of a network interface                               |
| DHCP        | Automatically assigns IP addresses on a network                       |
| NAT         | Network Address Translation ‚Äî allows multiple devices to share one IP |
| Port        | Logical access channel for communication (e.g., port 22 = SSH)        |

### üîÄ Network Types

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Limited to a building or campus
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Broader networks like the internet
* **Switch**: Connects devices within LAN
* **Router**: Connects LAN to WAN

## üß© Part 2: The 5 Layers of Computer Networking (Simplified TCP/IP Model)

Computer networking is typically divided into 5 abstract layers, each with specific responsibilities and headers:

| Layer           | Purpose                                       | Example Protocols        | Header Example            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Application** | Interface for user applications               | HTTP, SSH, DNS, FTP      | HTTP headers, DNS records |
| **Transport**   | Ensures reliable communication, manages ports | TCP, UDP                 | TCP/UDP header (port #s)  |
| **Network**     | Routing and addressing between networks       | IP, ICMP                 | IP header (IP address)    |
| **Data Link**   | Direct link communication on local network    | Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11) | MAC header                |
| **Physical**    | Transmission of bits over physical medium     | Cables, Wi-Fi radios     | Voltage/pulse or RF wave  |

### üõ†Ô∏è Linux Implementation of Each Layer

| Layer       | Linux Tools / Files               | Kernel/Driver Components            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Application | curl, wget, ssh, scp              | User space tools                    |
| Transport   | ss, netstat, iptables             | TCP/UDP stacks in kernel (net/ipv4) |
| Network     | ip, ifconfig, traceroute, ip rule | IP routing tables, netfilter        |
| Data Link   | ethtool, iw, nmcli                | Network driver, MAC layer           |
| Physical    | rfkill, iwconfig, hciconfig       | Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip drivers        |

## üì∂ Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Networking

Jetson supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, often via M.2 cards or USB dongles.

### üì° Wi-Fi Management Tools

```bash
nmcli device wifi list      # Scan for Wi-Fi networks
nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <password>
iwconfig                   # View wireless settings (deprecated)
```

### üîµ Bluetooth Tools

```bash
bluetoothctl               # Interactive Bluetooth manager
rfkill list                # Check if Bluetooth/Wi-Fi are blocked
hciconfig                  # View Bluetooth device configuration
```

---

## üß™ Network Discovery and Performance Testing

### üåê Discover Devices on LAN

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

### üìä Measure Speed and Latency

#### `iperf3` ‚Äî Network Bandwidth Testing

```bash
# On one device (server):
iperf3 -s

# On another device (client):
iperf3 -c <server-ip>
```

#### `ping` ‚Äî Latency Test

```bash
ping google.com
```

#### `speedtest-cli` ‚Äî Internet Speed Test

```bash
sudo apt install speedtest-cli
speedtest-cli
```
