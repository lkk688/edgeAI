```bash
% conda activate mypy311
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-revealjs
```

### 2. Build and serve the site locally

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open your browser to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 3. Build for static HTML site

```bash
mkdocs build
```

HTML files will be generated in the `site/` directory.

### 4. Export to PDF (Optional)

Install `weasyprint` or use browser print-to-PDF from `localhost:8000`.
