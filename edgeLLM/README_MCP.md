# Ollama MCP Gradio Client

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) client built with Gradio, optimized for **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** and **Apple Silicon** devices. This client uses local Ollama models instead of cloud APIs, making it perfect for edge AI applications.

Referenced and modified based on [Gradio's MCP example](https://www.gradio.app/main/guides/building-an-mcp-client-with-gradio), which makes call to Claude API. We have modified the code to make calls to local Ollama models instead and optimized for edge devices.

- Network connectivity for external tests

### External MCP Servers

You can also connect to external MCP servers. For example, to use image generation:

1. **Create an image generation MCP server** (based on the Gradio tutorial):
   ```python
   # Save as image_mcp_server.py
   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
   from gradio_client import Client
   import json
   
   mcp = FastMCP("image_generator")
   
   @mcp.tool()
   async def generate_image(prompt: str, width: int = 512, height: int = 512) -> str:
       client = Client("https://stabilityai-stable-diffusion-xl.hf.space/")
       result = client.predict(prompt, api_name="/predict")
       return json.dumps({"type": "image", "url": result})
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       mcp.run(transport='stdio')
   ```

2. **Connect in the Gradio interface**:
   - Enter `./image_mcp_server.py` in the "Server Path" field
   - Click "Connect"
   - Enable "MCP Tools" checkbox
   - Ask for image generation: "Generate an image of a sunset"

## Platform-Specific Optimizations

### NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano

- **Memory Management**: Automatically limits CUDA memory usage to 70%
- **Power Efficiency**: Optimized for Jetson's power constraints
- **GPU Monitoring**: Uses `jetson-stats` if available
- **Thermal Management**: Monitors temperature and throttling

**Recommended Settings:**
```bash
# Set power mode for better performance
sudo nvpmodel -m 0  # MAXN mode
sudo jetson_clocks   # Max clocks

# Monitor with jetson-stats
sudo pip install jetson-stats
jtop
```

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

- **MPS Support**: Utilizes Metal Performance Shaders when available
- **Unified Memory**: Optimized for Apple's unified memory architecture
- **Power Efficiency**: Leverages Apple Silicon's efficiency cores
- **Native Performance**: Runs natively on ARM64

**Recommended Settings:**
```bash
# Install Ollama with Apple Silicon optimization
brew install ollama

# Use models optimized for Apple Silicon
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Disable Gradio analytics (recommended for edge devices)
export GRADIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=False

# For Jetson devices
export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID

# For Apple Silicon
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
```

### Memory Optimization

**For Jetson (8GB RAM):**
- Use 1B or 3B parameter models
- Limit CUDA memory fraction to 0.7
- Close unnecessary applications

**For Apple Silicon (8GB+ unified memory):**
- 3B models work well on 8GB
- 8B models recommended for 16GB+
- MPS automatically manages memory

## Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

The networking and cybersecurity tools included in this MCP server are powerful and should be used responsibly:

#### Network Scanning Ethics
- **Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test**
- Unauthorized network scanning may violate laws and terms of service
- Always follow responsible disclosure practices
- Be aware of your organization's security policies

#### Tool Privileges
- **Packet capture requires root/administrator privileges**
- Some security scans may trigger security alerts
- Network tools may be blocked by firewalls
- Consider running in isolated environments for testing

#### Data Privacy
- Network captures may contain sensitive information
- HTTP requests may expose credentials or personal data
- Be cautious when sharing tool outputs
- Consider data retention and disposal policies

#### Safe Usage Guidelines
1. **Test in controlled environments first**
2. **Use minimal necessary privileges**
3. **Monitor and log tool usage**
4. **Regularly update security tools**
5. **Follow your organization's cybersecurity policies**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Ollama server not running"**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   # Wait a few seconds, then try again
   ```

2. **"No models available"**
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ollama list  # Verify model is installed
   ```

3. **"MCP server connection failed"**
   - Check the server path is correct
   - Ensure the MCP server file is executable
   - Check Python dependencies are installed

4. **High memory usage on Jetson**
   ```bash
   # Use smaller models
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   
   # Monitor memory
   free -h
   jtop  # If jetson-stats installed
   ```

5. **Slow performance**
   - Use smaller models (1B-3B parameters)
   - Close other applications
   - Check system temperature (Jetson)
   - Ensure adequate cooling

6. **Networking tools not working**
   - Install required tools: `sudo apt install nmap tcpdump wireshark-common`
   - Check user privileges for packet capture
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check firewall rules

       mcp.run(transport='stdio')
   ```

2. **Connect in the client**: Enter the path to your server file
